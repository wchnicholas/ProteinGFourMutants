#HEATMAP
From analysis/Heatmap_G41LV54H or analysis/Heatmap_V39WV54H:
  - Use matlab
  - Max 7.5 (RGB: 212, 208, 200); 1 step below max (RGB: 255, 0, 255); Min -7.5 (0 255 255); Midpoint 0 (RGB 255 255 255)
  - remove all tick marks and labels, no color bar
  - set(gcf,'PaperPosition',[0 0 10 10])
  - print('-dtiff','-r50','/Users/wchnicholas/RSun/G4/Mapping/graph/HMG41LV54H.png')

From analysis/HeatMapEpiRange:
  - Use matlab
  - Max 13.0 (RGB: 0, 0, 0); 1 step below max (RGB: 153, 51, 0); CData = 9.41 (RGB: 255, 215, 0) 
  - CData = 6.04 (RGB: 255, 255, 255); 1 step above min (RGB 255, 255, 255); min -0.5 (RGB 212, 208, 200)
  - remove all tick marks and labels, no color bar

From analysis/HeatMapEpiSD:
  - Use matlab
  - Max 2.1 (RGB: 0, 0, 0); 1 step below max (RGB: 153, 51, 0); CData = 1 (RGB: 255, 255, 255); min (RGB 255, 255, 255)
  - remove all tick marks and labels, no color bar

#LANDSCAPES
Neigboring Correlation
  Pairwise-infered landscape:
    Pearson Cor = 0.3170471 (Fitness at Linear Scale)
    Pearson Cor = 0.6888926 (Fitness at Log Scale)
    Rank Cor    = 0.6734648
  Original Landsape:
    Pearson Cor = 0.4033777 (Fitness at Linear Scale)
    Pearson Cor = 0.593438  (Fitness at Log Scale, -Inf Ignored)
    Rank Cor    = 0.4020489

#INTERSTING PATHS FROM WT (VDGV)
END point: YIFG, YIFV, F.F.
Away and Neutral steps: From PIWI to FWLG (greedy path in analysis/LocalMaxClimb_greedy)
Away and Neutral steps: From VDGV to LYGV (weight path in simulations/weight/LocalMaxClimb_*)
Away ana Neutral steps: From VDGV to VHGL (shortest path in analysis/LocalMaxEvolvePotWT)

#SUBGRAPH ANALYSIS
YGCM (low fitness) to VDGV (WT) has only 1 local peak (VDGV), but a reversal path exists, ignored for graph analysis.
TGYE (low fitness) to VDGV (WT) has only 1 local peak (VDGV), but TGYE and TDYE has the same fitness, messed up analysis
FPKQ (low fitness) to VDGV (WT) has only 1 local peak (VDGV), but FDKQ and VDKQ has the same fitness, messed up analysis` 

#HIGH ORDER EPISTASIS EXAMPLES:
awk {'if ($4>0.5 && $7>0.5 && $5<0.1 && $6<0.1) print'} analysis/AllPairwiseEpi
grep G41M-V54G analysis/AllPairwiseEpi | grep .LGV #To search for high order epistasis
WLGV to WLMG pair with LLGV to LLMG
